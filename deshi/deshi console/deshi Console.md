# deshi Console   
   
---   
deshi's console system. Built using [UI](../../deshi/deshi%20ui/deshi%20UI.md) and strictly relies on the [Logger](../../deshi/deshi%20logger/deshi%20Logger.md). It's primary purpose is to provide an interface for using [commands](../../deshi/deshi%20command/deshi%20Command.md) and to replace the external console.
